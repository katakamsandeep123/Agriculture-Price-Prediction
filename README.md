The Agriculture Price Prediction project is designed to forecast crop prices based on state, region, and nearest market data using advanced machine learning techniques in Python. The project employs several machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbours, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machines (both Linear and RBF Kernels), Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. Each model's performance is evaluated based on the R² metric, with Linear Regression achieving the highest accuracy with an R² score of 99.53470, followed closely by the Support Vector Machine with a Linear Kernel at 99.65024. 

The model with the best performance, Linear Regression, is selected for deployment. The entire system is built into an interactive web application using Streamlit, providing an intuitive user interface for users to input relevant data and receive instant price predictions. This application aims to empower farmers, traders, and stakeholders by offering precise and timely price forecasts, helping them make informed decisions and plan their activities more effectively. The project's robust predictive capabilities and accessible interface underscore its potential to significantly impact the agricultural sector by enhancing market transparency and efficiency.
